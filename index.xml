      <description>Have a kid, they said. It&amp;rsquo;ll be fun, they said. I really really love being a familyman, and practicing the #dadops. I may one day give you the rundown on what being a Dad means to me, and the positive changes that process has brought ( or sometimes shoved ) into my life, but today is not that day.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna celebrate a creation of my 6 and a half-ish old daughter.</description>

      <description>in Seattle&amp;hellip; One of the neat things about living in Seattle is that Seattle has quite a lot of retired philanthropic bazillionaires about the town.
One of those bazillionaires is Paul Allen ( $MSFT co-founder ). He&amp;rsquo;s founded a handful of museums and other things around town, including Living Computers museum + labs.
Well, I got the chance to go there this evening ( FREE from 5:00-8:00pm on First Thursdays ).</description>
