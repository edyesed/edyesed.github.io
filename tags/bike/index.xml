      <description>Seattle + Bikes Our family has made Seattle our home for the past few years. One thing that&amp;rsquo;s nice about Seattle is that the weather is always terrible actually pretty moderate. Fun Story: when we moved up here from Memphis, TN, we didn&amp;rsquo;t change USDA Plant Hardiness Zones. Seattle&amp;rsquo;s got some üö≤/üëü trails by which you can Ô∏èüö≤Ô∏è throughout the city. This is very nice when the weather&amp;rsquo;s good. We have access to almost all parts of town that we care to visit, including a &amp;ldquo;beach&amp;rdquo;, from our home without having to ride too much on city streets.</description>
